my first algorithm implementation (i.e, the R.I.A.S.E.C. Algorithm) while in high school, built with pure HTML5/CSS, Javascript, and deployed to [Github Pages](https://classito.github.io/MyFuture/pages/riasecPage.html).

### R.I.A.S.E.C. algorithm (Scoring System)
At the heart of MyFuture is the R.I.A.S.E.C. algorithm, a robust framework based on psychological theory to assess users' personalities and preferences. This algorithm categorizes personalities into six types: Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, and Conventional. By engaging students with a series of carefully designed questions, the algorithm evaluates their responses to identify their dominant personality traits. This process ensures an optimal match between the students' inherent interests and the available academic pathways at Waipahu High School.

### Categorization of Personality Types
The algorithm classifies personalities into six distinct categories, as per the R.I.A.S.E.C. model:

Realistic (R): Prefers practical, hands-on activities.

Investigative (I): Enjoys solving puzzles and engaging in analytical tasks.

Artistic (A): Drawn to creative and artistic expressions.

Social (S): Favors roles involving interaction with others.

Enterprising (E): Interested in leading and persuading others, often in business.

Conventional (C): Prefers structured, rule-regulated tasks.


### Questionnaire and Response Analysis
Design of Questions: Each question in the survey is structured to elicit responses indicative of one or more R.I.A.S.E.C. personality traits.
Response Weighting: Students' answers are assigned weights based on the extent to which they reflect a specific personality type. For instance, a question might have a higher weight for 'Investigative' if it pertains to problem-solving skills.

### Scoring and Trait Identification
Scoring System: As students respond, the algorithm calculates scores for each of the six personality types. This is done by aggregating the weights of responses corresponding to each category.
Dominant Trait Identification: The personality type with the highest score is identified as the student’s dominant trait.

### Mapping to Academic Pathways
Pathway Association: Each academic pathway at Waipahu High School is aligned with one or more R.I.A.S.E.C. personality types. For example, a science pathway might be linked to 'Investigative' and 'Realistic' traits.

### Optimal Match Algorithm: 
The algorithm then matches the student’s dominant personality trait(s) with the associated academic pathways. If a student scores highly in 'Artistic', they would be matched with pathways that nurture creativity.

### Personalized Recommendations
The final output is a list of recommended academic pathways tailored to the student’s assessed personality type, offering a personalized educational direction.
