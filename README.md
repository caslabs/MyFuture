We designed the algorithm to replicate closely to the RIASEC survey. We connect the user's answered questions to a hash-table data structure and developed a simple scoring algorithm to match the user's preference to Waipahu High School's active academy pathways. Each pathway is connected to possible and viable classes that the user may would like to research and take part in during the next semester.
